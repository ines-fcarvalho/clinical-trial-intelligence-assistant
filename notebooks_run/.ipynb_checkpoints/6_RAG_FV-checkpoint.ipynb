Consider refining these criteria to potentially broaden the eligible patient population while maintaining safety and scientific rigor. For example, the criteria could be revised to allow enrollment of patients who have received a specific number of prior lines of therapy or to specify acceptable washout periods for prior treatments.\\n2.  **Comparator Arm Considerations:** The context does not specify the comparator arm for NCT00404924. If the comparator is a standard-of-care treatment, consider whether a more novel or targeted therapy might be a more appropriate comparator to demonstrate a significant improvement in outcomes.\""
